# Mathematical Expression Parser

This project provides a simple implementation of a mathematical expression parser in C++. The parser converts an infix mathematical expression into a postfix expression. The implementation includes a lexer for tokenizing the input string and a parser for converting the token stream into a postfix expression.

## Introduction

The project consists of two main components: the Lexer and the Parser.

### Lexer
The Lexer class is responsible for tokenizing the input string. It recognizes integer literals and basic arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Unknown characters are handled with an error message.

### Parser
The Parser class takes the token stream generated by the Lexer and converts it into a postfix expression. It uses a stack to handle operator precedence and outputs the postfix expression.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the Project File

2. Load it to your c++ working enviroment

3. Add the Path of your input file that contains the expression you wish to parse

```cpp
  // Open the input file
  ifstream in("File_Path"); // Replace File_Path with your input file path.
  // Path example: "C:/Users/projects/C++/input.txt"
  if (!in.is_open()) {
    cout << "Error opening file\n";
    return 1;
  }
```

## Token Types

The project defines five token types:

- `TYPE_INT`: Integer literals
- `TYPE_PLUS`: Addition operator (`+`)
- `TYPE_MINUS`: Subtraction operator (`-`)
- `TYPE_MULTI`: Multiplication operator (`*`)
- `TYPE_DIV`: Division operator (`/`)

## Lexer

The Lexer class tokenizes the input string using the defined token types. It recognizes integer literals and basic arithmetic operators. Unknown characters are reported as errors.

## Parser

The Parser class takes the token stream generated by the Lexer and converts it into a postfix expression. It uses a stack to handle operator precedence and outputs the postfix expression.

## Example

To illustrate the usage, consider the following input file (`input.txt`):

```
3 + 5 * 2 - 8 / 4
```

Running the program with this input will output the postfix expression:

```
3 5 2 * + 8 4 / -
```

This represents the equivalent postfix expression of the given infix expression.

Feel free to modify the main function to read input from different sources or customize the code according to your requirements.
