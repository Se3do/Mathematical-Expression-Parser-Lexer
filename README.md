# Mathematical Expression Parser\Lexer

## Project Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of a mathematical expression parser. The primary goal is to tokenize an input string representing a mathematical expression, convert it into a postfix expression, and print the result. The application uses a lexer to tokenize the input and a parser to convert the token stream into a postfix expression.

## Introduction

The project consists of two main components: the Lexer class and the Parser class.

### Lexer class:
The Lexer class is responsible for tokenizing the input string. It recognizes integer literals and basic arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Unknown characters are handled with an error message.

### Parser class:
The Parser class takes the token stream generated by the Lexer and converts it into a postfix expression. It uses a stack to handle operator precedence and outputs the postfix expression.





## Features

### Token Types:

The project defines five token types:

- `TYPE_INT`: Integer literals
- `TYPE_PLUS`: Addition operator (`+`)
- `TYPE_MINUS`: Subtraction operator (`-`)
- `TYPE_MULTI`: Multiplication operator (`*`)
- `TYPE_DIV`: Division operator (`/`)
  
### Lexer:
- **Tokenization:** The lexer processes the input string and identifies tokens, including integer literals and basic arithmetic operators.
- **Error Handling:** Detects and reports unknown characters, providing feedback on unexpected input.

### Parser:
- **Operator Precedence:** Handles operator precedence to create a postfix expression.
- **Output Formatting:** Prints the postfix expression for the given mathematical expression.
- **Integration:** Integrates with the lexer to process the token stream efficiently.

### Main Function:
- **Input Handling:** Reads input from an external file specified by the user.
- **Stream Optimization:** Utilizes input/output stream optimizations for improved performance.
- **File Handling:** Checks for file existence and reports errors if the file cannot be opened.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone [repository_url]`
2. **Open the project:** In a C++ development environment.
3. **Specify input path:** Add the Path of your input file that contains the expression you wish to parse

```cpp
  // Open the input file
  ifstream in("File_Path"); // Replace File_Path with your input file path.
  // Path example: "C:/Users/projects/C++/input.txt"
  if (!in.is_open()) {
    cout << "Error opening file\n";
    return 1;
  }
```
4. **Run the application:** Execute the main program to tokenize and parse the mathematical expression, printing the postfix expression.


## Example

To illustrate the usage, consider the following input file (`input.txt`):

```
3 + 5 * 2 - 8 / 4
```

Running the program with this input will output the postfix expression:

```
3 5 2 * + 8 4 / -
```

This represents the equivalent postfix expression of the given infix expression.

Feel free to modify the main function to read input from different sources or customize the code according to your requirements.


## Dependencies

No external dependencies are required beyond a standard C++ development environment.
